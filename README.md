# CovidTrends
CovidTrends is a small tool i've created to inspect correlations between Google trends data and Covid-19 data in U.S, hopefully to support and inspire further research

# HowTo
Simply run the notebook, you will be prompted to choose dates:

![DatePicker](img/HowtoA.jpg)

And also choose a search term:

![TermPicker](img/HowtoB.jpg)

Then you will be able to inspect the results. e.g:

![CorrelationHeatmap](img/CorrelationHeatmap.jpg)

![CaliforniaPeriodAfterVaccine](img//CaliforniaPeriodAfterVaccine.jpg)
